# Economic Brain Lab

Welcome to the Economic Brain Lab at Swinburne University of Technology, Melbourne.

We investigate the intersection of neuroscience, psychology, and economics to understand how the brain makes economic decisions. Our research combines neuroimaging, behavioral experiments, and computational modeling.

## Research Focus
- Neural mechanisms of decision-making under uncertainty and risk
- Effort-based and temporal (delay) discounting
- Metacognition as a mechanism of behavioral control
- Computational models of value-based choice

## Open Science
We're committed to transparent, reproducible research. Here you'll find:
- Analysis code and computational models
- Experimental paradigms and protocols
- Data processing pipelines
- Teaching materials
